A collection of subject tasks.

* Tetris: Change the game so that hitting the space key during game play causes the current figure to fall immediately as far down as it can. This feature spares the player from having to hit the down arrow key many times in succession. The figure's fast fall does not need to be animated. The figure can simply disappear from its current position and reappear at the bottom of the grid.

* Pacman: In the existing game, if a power pellet is collected, the ghosts turn blue, slow down, and can be eaten for points. Change the game so that if a power pellet is collected, the ghosts instead freeze in place until a timer runs out.

* Space Invaders: In the existing implementation, when the player fires a shot, it either hits an enemy or reaches the top of the screen. Change the game so that whenever the player fires a shot that misses an enemy, a new enemy is created. The new enemy is placed in the lowest row of enemies, filling in an empty position if possible. If all enemies positions are filled, no new enemy is created.
